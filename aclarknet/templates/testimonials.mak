    Hello Alex,

    Wanted to thank you for an excellent class at Penn State and look forward to further classes in the future.
    â€¦ you are one of the best instructors I ever meet when it comes to the Plone CMS.

    Thank you (among other things) for 'Plone 3.3 site administration'. Hopefully you&apos;ll publish 'Plone 4 administration' some day ...

    In 2006, Alex helped Radio Free Asia move their website content from Bricolage to Plone. This was a challenging task not many were willing to undertake, so we especially appreciate his skill and dedication to our project.

    Alex helped free my Plone website from the clutches of an unwanted add-on that had rendered it useless.  He quickly analyzed and corrected the problem without unnecessary procedures and contract terms.
